## 🚨 **CRITICAL WARNINGS - READ THIS**

### **⚠️ THERMAL MANAGEMENT**
- This **WILL** push your CPU to 100% utilization
- **Monitor temperatures**: Use `watch sensors` or similar
- **Thermal throttling kills performance** - ensure adequate cooling
- **Recommended**: High-performance cooling (liquid preferred)

### **⚠️ SYSTEM IMPACT**
- **Real-time priorities** can make system unresponsive
- **Maximum power consumption** - ensure adequate PSU
- **Test in controlled environment** before production use

## 🛠️ **ADVANCED USAGE**

### **Custom Workloads**
```bash
# Syntax: ./hardcore_performance [duration] [vector_size]
./bin/hardcore_performance 30 10485760    # 30 sec, 10M elements
./bin/hardcore_performance 60 1048576     # 60 sec, 1M elements
```

### **Thread Affinity & Priority**
```bash
# Pin to specific cores + highest priority (Linux)
sudo taskset -c 0-7 nice -n -20 ./bin/hardcore_performance

# Windows equivalent (run as Administrator)
start /realtime /affinity 0xFF hardcore_performance.exe
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor system during workload
./bin/performance_monitor 500 &    # 500ms updates
./bin/hardcore_performance 60      # Run workload
killall performance_monitor        # Stop monitoring
```

## 📊 **SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION LEVELS**

### **Level 1: Compilation** ✅ *Automatic*
- Maximum compiler optimization with CPU-specific tuning
- SIMD instruction acceleration (AVX2/FMA)
- Link-time optimization across modules

### **Level 2: OS Configuration** 🔧 *Run `make optimize`*
- CPU governor set to performance mode
- CPU frequency locked to maximum
- Disable CPU idle states and power management
- Optimize kernel scheduling parameters

### **Level 3: Hardware** 🌡️ *Manual*
- High-performance cooling system
- Quality PSU with stable power delivery
- BIOS optimizations (disable C-states, Turbo Boost)
- Fast RAM with low latency timings

---

## 🎛️ **MONITORING & DIAGNOSTICS**

### **Key Performance Indicators**
- **CPU Usage**: Should approach 100% during workload
- **Temperature**: Keep below 80°C sustained load
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for leaks or excessive allocation
- **Operations/sec**: Should be consistent across cores

### **Warning Signs**
- 🔥 **Temperature > 85°C**: Immediate attention needed
- ⚠️ **Frequency drops**: Thermal or power throttling
- 📉 **Decreasing performance**: Background interference
- 💾 **Memory growth**: Potential memory leak

---

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**Q: Lower performance than expected?**
- Check CPU governor: `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor`
- Verify no thermal throttling: `dmesg | grep -i thermal`
- Ensure adequate cooling and power delivery

**Q: System becomes unresponsive?**
- Real-time priority too aggressive - use `nice -n -10` instead of `-20`
- Background processes interfering - close unnecessary applications
- Insufficient cooling causing thermal throttling

**Q: Compilation errors?**
- Check AVX2 support: `grep avx2 /proc/cpuinfo`
- Update compiler: GCC 7.0+ recommended
- Install development packages: `sudo apt install build-essential`
